# 🌀 Manogit

**Manogit** is a minimal reimplementation of Git, built in Python for educational purposes. It recreates core Git functionality from scratch, helping developers understand the internals of how Git works under the hood.

## 🔧 What It Does

Manogit currently supports:

- `init` – Initialize a new Manogit repository
- `add` – Stage files for the next commit
- `commit` – Commit changes with messages
- `log` – View commit history
- `status` – Check file states (staged, modified, untracked)
- `checkout` – Switch between commits 
- `branch` – Create or switch branches 

> ⚠️ Manogit is not a full replacement for Git. It’s meant for learning and experimentation.
